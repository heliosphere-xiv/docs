# Searching

Heliosphere's search function has two primary modes: **simple** and
**advanced**.

## Simple search

The simple search will go through titles, descriptions, taglines, and
permissions, pulling up any mods with matching terms or words.

To use this, simply put your desired search terms in the query box and click
"Search".

Note that titles are weighted most heavily, then descriptions, then taglines,
then permissions.

## Advanced search

Clicking the "Advanced" slider at the top of the screen or the text that says
"Enable advanced search" below the main query box will enable advanced search.

The Query box retains its function from simple search, but there are a number of
other items added by advanced search.

1. **Author**: If you know a specific author's name and want to limit your
   search to only the mods they have made, you can type either their full or
   partial name here, then select their name from the dropdown menu.
2. **Categories**: This section specifies which types of mods you want to show
   up in the search. You may select multiple options at the same time.
3. **Race & gender**: This section is split into a female and a male section,
   and allows you to find mods that are compatible with all the combinations of
   race and gender that your select. Selecting "Any" for either gender will
   choose all the races for that gender.
4. **Tags**: You may search for tags that mods have been given by mod authors in
   this section, and add them as additional filters to your search. Mods with
   these tags will then appear in the search results.
5. **Excluded tags**: Any mods with tags that are included in this section will
   not be included in your search.
6. **Affects**: If you know the in-game name of the gear item, action, NPC, or
   emote that you would like to find a mod to affect, then you may add it in
   here.
7. **Subscriber status**: This option will allow you to limit your results to
   include mods only from Heliosphere creators that are subscribers (creators
   who are supporting Heliosphere by paying a monthly fee), exclude mods from
   subscribers, or make no distinctions.
8. **Order**: This option lets you choose how your search results are sorted, in
   combination with the next option on this list, *Direction*.
   - *Created at* will sort mods by the date they were created.
   - *Downloaded at* will sort mods by when someone last downloaded them.
   - *Downloads (all time)* will sort mods by their *total* number of
      downloads.
   - *Downloads (average)* will sort mods by their *average* number of
      downloads per uploaded version.
   - *Similarity* will sort mods by how similar they are to your initial search
      query.
   - *Updated at* will sort mods by when they were last updated.
9. **Direction**: Choosing *Ascending* will, in combination with the *Order*
   option, sort the results from lowest to highest; *Descending* will sort the
   results from highest to lowest.

   If *Order* relies on a date, such as "Created at" or "Updated at",
   *Ascending* will sort from oldest to newest, while *Descending* will sort
   from newest to oldest.
10. **Compatibility**: Mods that were uploaded or last updated prior to June 28,
    2024 will have preceded the release of *Dawntrail*, the fifth major
    expansion to *Final Fantasy XIV* since *A Realm Reborn*.

    Because *Dawntrail* made major graphical changes to the engine, any mods
    that predate the release of *Dawntrail* will likely not function correctly
    when downloaded into Penumbra through Heliosphere. These mods will be marked
    with a warning sign on their thumbnails, both on the main page and in search
    results.

    Selecting "Any" will include these mods in your search results, while
    selecting "Dawntrail" will exclude them.
11. **Number of results**: This controls how many search results are
    shown per page in your search.
